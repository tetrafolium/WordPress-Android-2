* Added Remote Preview support for posts and pages.
* Trashed posts stay trashed. They must be restored before editing or previewing.
* Fixed: Clicking on “Publish” on a private post now reliably publishes the post as private, some link editing issues resolved.
* Unsaved changes to posts and pages are automatically backed up.
